\begin{abstract}
This research presents a comprehensive machine learning approach for short-term cryptocurrency price forecasting, specifically targeting XRP/USDT price prediction using Random Forest regression with extensively engineered technical indicators. Our model utilizes 25 carefully engineered features including OHLC prices, moving averages, momentum indicators, and temporal features to predict XRP prices for the next hour in 3-minute intervals. The ensemble approach employs 100 decision trees with a MultiOutputRegressor wrapper to handle simultaneous multi-step predictions. The model was trained on 7 days of historical data (3,360 data points) from June 15-22, 2025, and evaluated on 7 test periods spanning different days and times from June 23-29, 2025 (all times in GMT+6, Bangladesh Standard Time). Our results demonstrate moderate predictive performance with an overall Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.014873, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.70\%, and correlation coefficient of 0.78 between predicted and actual prices. The model achieved optimal performance during June 29, 6-AM-7-AM period (0.09\% MAPE) and consistent performance during morning hours across different days. This study contributes to the growing field of cryptocurrency price prediction by demonstrating the potential of ensemble methods combined with comprehensive technical analysis features for short-term forecasting applications across diverse temporal conditions.

\section{Introduction}

Cryptocurrency markets have emerged as one of the most dynamic and volatile financial sectors, characterized by 24/7 trading, high price volatility, and complex market dynamics influenced by various factors including market sentiment, regulatory developments, and technological innovations \cite{nakamoto2008bitcoin}. Among the numerous cryptocurrencies, XRP (Ripple) has established itself as a significant digital asset, primarily designed for facilitating cross-border payments and serving as a bridge currency in international transactions.

The prediction of cryptocurrency prices represents a challenging task due to the inherent volatility, non-linear dependencies, and the influence of multiple external factors \cite{ji2019does}. Traditional econometric models often fail to capture the complex patterns present in cryptocurrency time series data, leading researchers to explore advanced machine learning techniques. Ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest regression, have shown promising results in financial time series prediction due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships, reduce overfitting, and provide robust predictions through the combination of multiple decision trees.

This research focuses on developing a sophisticated Random Forest-based forecasting model for XRP price prediction, incorporating comprehensive technical analysis indicators and temporal features. The study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of ensemble learning methods in capturing short-term price movements in the volatile cryptocurrency market.

\subsection{Research Objectives}

The primary objectives of this research are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a robust Random Forest regression model for short-term XRP price forecasting
    \item To evaluate the effectiveness of engineered technical indicators in ensemble-based cryptocurrency prediction
    \item To analyze model performance across different temporal conditions and market scenarios
    \item To provide insights into the practical applications of ensemble methods for cryptocurrency trading strategies
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}

This research makes several key contributions to the field of cryptocurrency price prediction:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Ensemble Architecture}: Implementation of a comprehensive Random Forest model with MultiOutputRegressor for simultaneous multi-step prediction
    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering}: Development of 25 engineered technical indicators specifically optimized for short-term cryptocurrency forecasting

\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Cryptocurrency Price Prediction}

Cryptocurrency price prediction has attracted significant attention from both academic researchers and financial practitioners. Early studies primarily relied on traditional econometric approaches, including ARIMA models and regression analysis \cite{katsiampa2017volatility}. However, these methods often failed to capture the complex, non-linear patterns characteristic of cryptocurrency markets.

The advent of machine learning techniques has revolutionized cryptocurrency price prediction. Deep learning approaches, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown promise in capturing temporal dependencies in price data \cite{mcnally2018predicting}. However, these methods often suffer from overfitting and require extensive computational resources.

\subsection{Ensemble Methods in Financial Forecasting}

Ensemble methods have gained prominence in financial forecasting due to their ability to combine multiple weak learners to create a strong predictor. Random Forest, introduced by Breiman (2001), has been particularly successful in financial applications due to its robustness to overfitting and ability to handle high-dimensional feature spaces \cite{breiman2001random}.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of Random Forest in stock price prediction \cite{khaidem2016predicting} and forex forecasting \cite{galeshchuk2016neural}. The method's inherent ability to provide feature importance rankings and handle non-linear relationships makes it particularly suitable for financial time series with multiple technical indicators.

\subsection{Technical Analysis in Algorithmic Trading}

Technical analysis forms the foundation of many algorithmic trading strategies. Studies have shown that technical indicators can provide valuable signals for short-term price movements \cite{brock1992simple}. The integration of multiple technical indicators through machine learning models has been shown to improve prediction accuracy compared to single-indicator approaches \cite{patel2015predicting}.
